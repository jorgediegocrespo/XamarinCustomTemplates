# XamarinCustomTemplates
Thanks to control templates, in Xamarin Forms, we can change the appearance of ContentViews and ContentPages at runtime. In this way, we can have different views of the same control or the same page, without this involving throwing away many lines of code or creating complex algorithms with which to decide what aspect to give to an element.
